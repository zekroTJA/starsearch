# starsearch

A very simple web application to better search your starred GitHub repositories and find stuff blazingly fast! ðŸ’«ðŸš€

This project actually emerged out of pure frustration with the starred repository search functionality built in to GitHub. [It is nearly impossible to find projects when the searched term is not exactly in the name or description of the repository.](https://github.com/zekroTJA/starsearch/assets/16734205/9752eb6d-d7df-442c-a315-2bd6b6c5d3bd) To fix this, I had the idea to simply index all starred repositories in a full text search friendly database (in this case [Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/)) to be able to search through them via a very simple web application.
